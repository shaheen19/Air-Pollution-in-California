# Air-Pollution-in-California
This is my first data science project during the UCSD-Bootcamp (2018). I am physical chemist by education and study planetary atmosphere and now acquiring new skills to handle large data sets. 
In this project, I haver analyzed atmospheric pollutnats data for all the 58 counties of the state of California and have used NOAA Hysplit Back trajectory to investigate sources of air pollution. 
I have analyzed correlatons between pollutants levels and asthma rates in this project.
